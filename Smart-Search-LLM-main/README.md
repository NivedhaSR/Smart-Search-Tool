# Smart-Search-LLM
Problem Statement:

We'd like you to showcase your skills by creating a smart search feature for the free courses on
Analytics Vidhya’s platform: Analytics Vidhya Free Courses. Your task is to build a Smart Search
tool that helps users find the most relevant free courses easily.
Here’s what you need to do:
1. Browse through the free courses on the platform: Explore and collect data (e.g.,
course titles, descriptions, curriculum) from the free courses available on Analytics
Vidhya.
2. Develop a smart search system: Build a search tool that quickly finds and suggests the
most relevant courses based on what the user is looking for. This should be based on an
LLM Model.
3. Deploy the tool on Huggingface Spaces: Once your search tool is ready, deploy it on
Huggingface Spaces. You can use any framework (such as Gradio, Streamlit, or others)
as long as it is publicly accessible via Huggingface Spaces.
4. Share the link for review: Provide us with the public link to your deployed smart search
tool for evaluation.
The more advanced and effective your search tool is, the better your chances of standing out.
We’re excited to see what you create!
